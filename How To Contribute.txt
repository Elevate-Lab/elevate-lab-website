Here's how you can set up and contribute to this Project!

1. Fork the repository using the "Fork" feature above.

2. Now, clone your Forked repo. This can be done in two ways:

	a) If you have Git Bash installed, then simply copy the link to your Forked repo, open Git Bash in your local system, and type 

	git clone <forked_repo_link>

	b) If you do not have Git Bash installed, then you can simply download the files in your Forked repo in a compressed format, using the option under the Code dropdown menu.

3. Now, go to the original repo and open the tab marked "Issues". Here you'll find all the open issues that you can contribute to. Open any issue of your choice, and if it hasn't been claimed by any one yet, you can comment something along the lines of "I would like to work on this!" following which you will be assigned the selfsame issue. 

4. Work! This is where you put your web development skills to use and find the best possible solution to the issue. Use Google, Stack Overflow, MDN Docs, or whatever resource you need, and finish contributing to the Project.

5. Once you have added the necessary files to your local repo, open Git Bash and type:
	git add .
This adds all the new files to the staging area, where they are made ready to be committed.

	git commit -m <Optional_Message>
The <Optional_Message> should be helpful and should describe what you have changed.

	git push origin master 

This will finally push the changes to your Forked repo.

6. Now, send a pull request to the original repo, describing briefly what changes you have made in order to resolve the issue. Your PR will be reviewed, and if the editions are deemed satisfactory, the PR will be merged with the original repo.

Happy Hacktoberfest!
